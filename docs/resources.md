The current release of the system is available here (at the moment VPN access is required for organization-level security regulations; get in touch to request access if you are interested in trying the tool; we are planning a deploy that overcome these limitation in the next future): **[semtui.io](http://vm.chronos.disco.unimib.it:3000/)**

NOTE: 
Due to University security policy it is available through UniMiB VPN only.

The github repository of the frontend is available here: **[SemTUI-frontend](https://github.com/I2Tunimib/I2T-frontend)**

The github repository of the backend is available here: **[SemTUI-backend](https://github.com/I2Tunimib/I2T-backend)**
