modular framework for the Semantic Enrichment of Tabular Data,
adoptable by both experts and non-experts in the context of semantics.
Nowadays, the enrichment task is at the core of almost every data
analytics pipeline, and at the same time, it proves to be also costly
in both time and money. For this reason, it is important to provide data scientists with tools that guide them through the steps of
the enrichment process, supporting them with interactive choices and
visualizations. Semantics can bridge the gap in finding links across
datasets and find solutions for the extension step, but it is important
to include users in the annotation process. Indeed, the extension step
is strongly related to the semantic annotation, but automatic algorithms that provide it can fail. However, if results are made available,
interpretable, and editable, they can be reviewed and improved by the
humanâ€™s knowledge.
A study and overview of state-of-the-art tools for both the Semantic Interpretation and Enrichment task have highlighted some of their
problems. They are limited by not supporting humans in the loop of
the annotation process, while also not fully providing extension steps
necessary to complete the enrichment of tabular data. Most of the
related works also present an entry barrier for less experienced users.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_y2LR" id="semantic-table-interpretation-and-annotation">Semantic Table Interpretation and Annotation<a aria-hidden="true" class="hash-link" href="#semantic-table-interpretation-and-annotation" title="Direct link to heading">â€‹</a></h2><p>Tables are used to represent data in a structured way, but their structure does
not own and give any information about the meaning of the data contained
in them. In the interest of grasping any contextual meaning towards data
represented in a table, tables can be aligned against ontologies. As described
in the previous section, ontologies create a common and shared meaning of
the knowledge contained in a particular data structure.
By considering a simple table, one where the first row is the header row
and the other ones contain the actual data (as shown in the figure), a set
of entities denoted as M can be constructed from its rows, columns and
cells. Given an ontology O defined as O = ã€ˆV, E, Lã€‰ where V is the set of
labeled vertices representing the entities, E is the set of edges representing
the relations, and L is a mapping from each edge to its label, the resulting
mapping matrix between M and O represents a mapping between ontology
concepts and a table entities.</p><p><img alt="Table anatomy" src="/I2T-docs/assets/images/table-anatomy-6a8fedc41d623955eca1bb5affd2e2b6.png"></p><p>A Semantic Table Interpretation (STI) approach considers each entry of the
resulting matrix as a relation between a mention in the table and a concept
in the ontology, of course a relation can also be missing.
In other words a STI algorithm has two inputs a table and a KG and its
output is a set of semantic data annotations which map mentions in the
table to the KG. The result of the mapping is the original table of data
enriched with semantic meanings. Different interpretations of the same table
lead to different sets of semantic annotations.</p><p>The task of STI is a challenging problem due to the lack of information in
a table (e.g.: missing header), noise, incompleteness, amibiguity and heterogeneity in the data. Of course, enriching a table with semantic data increases
the value of the original raw data making them even more useful in different
types of data analytics and data science applications. Evaluating state-of-
the-art systems for STI isnâ€™t easy and for this reason in 2019, the Semantic
Web Challenge on Tabular Data to Knowledge Graph Matching (SemTab)
has been established. This challenge introduced a standard terminology
for the annotations resulted from an algorithm of STI and are as follow:</p><ul><li><em>Cell Entity Annotation (<strong>CEA</strong>)</em>: cell based annotation also known as
istance-level annotation;</li><li><em>Column Type Annotation (<strong>CTA</strong>)</em>: schema-level annotation determined
to link columns to a KG ontology;</li><li><em>Column Predicate Annotation (<strong>CPA</strong>)</em>: schema-level annotation determined to find binary relations (proerties of the KG ontology) between
pair of columns of the table;</li></ul><p>Those annotations may be generated separately from different interpretation tasks, while other STI approaches use the information of one annotation
task to support the other. For example CEA can provide insightful information about the CTA (e.g.: the types of the annotated cells of a column might
be entities of type Actor which also identify the column type).
One example and state-of-the-art approach for the the automatic STI is Mantis Table presented in the SemTab 2021. This approach is also manageble
from an earlier version of SemTUI called tUI. Indeed, starting from this
year (2021), the SemTab challenge as well as evaluating the STI approach,
also evaluates the user interface used to perform the task. This is because
the challenge is becoming aware of the importance of the task even for less
experienced users in the domain.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_y2LR" id="instance-level-annotation">Instance-level annotation<a aria-hidden="true" class="hash-link" href="#instance-level-annotation" title="Direct link to heading">â€‹</a></h3><p>The task of annotating the textual values in the table cells (mentions) constits of an entity linking algorithm which objective is to disambiguate mentions from the entities inside a KG.
While entity linking algorithms on free text can use the contextual information given by the sorrounding words of a target entity to disambiguate
between entities in the KG, on tabular data they exploit the structure
of the table for both the mentions in the raw and the column of the target
mention to support the result of the disambiguation.</p><p>Three primary tasks are involved into instance-level annotation in tabular
data and are then combined into a single pipeline:</p><ul><li><em>Candidates retrieval</em>: each mention of the table is matched against a
target KG retrieving a candidate list of entities. The list could also
be empty e.g.: the mention is a number representing a temperature in
degree celsius. KGs can be huge data structures containing millions
of entities therefore, indexing techniques are employed to make this
step more efficient. Some state-of-the-art examples to query KGs are
FactBase and Knowledge Graph Toolkit;</li><li><em>Candidates Ranking</em>: candidate entities retrieved from the previous
phase are then ranked based on the combination of multiple scores,
e.g.: similarity scores, and other more in depth processes;</li><li><em>Decision making</em>: based on the proofs gathered up until this phase, a
decision is finally made to whether link or not the target label providing
the final annotation for the considered table mention;</li></ul><p>Different techniques can be employed to rank and decide on which of the
initial candidates are going to be the annotation for a given cell. The final
decision can be made by selecting the top rankings or based on thresholds,
even though scores from lookup services (e.g.: Lucene score) are usually
unbuonded, meaning they arenâ€™t and canâ€™t be normalized in an interval.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_y2LR" id="schema-level-annotation">Schema-level annotation<a aria-hidden="true" class="hash-link" href="#schema-level-annotation" title="Direct link to heading">â€‹</a></h3><p>The other task of STI, which retrieves annotation metadata for the table,
is applied to its structure. The schema-level annotation task aims to map
the underlying table schema to a KG ontology. Usually, this task is tackled after the instance-level annotation because of the usuful insights given
from the annotated cells, i.e.: types of the annotated cells give clues for the
column class. The annotation of the schema involves two different types of
annotation:</p><ul><li><em>Column type</em> : a column can represent named entities (e.g.: in the previous figure
Football Club, Managar, Team Captain, Supplier are all named entities), but also literal values (e.g.: dates of events). For each column, the
algorithm decides whether to annotate a column as named entity, assigning one or more classes of the KG ontology, or as a literal, possibly
specifying a datatype;</li><li><em>Columns relations</em> : the algorithm also tries to find the relations that
might exist between each pair of columns. The task aims to annotate
each pair with a property from the KG.</li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_y2LR" id="semantic-table-enrichment">Semantic Table Enrichment<a aria-hidden="true" class="hash-link" href="#semantic-table-enrichment" title="Direct link to heading">â€‹</a></h2><p>The raise of Big Data and the improvements of computational power in the
recent years, lead to notable advancements in data analytics and data science
in treating and analyzing huge amounts of data to perform various tasks of
analysis and prediction.
ML models starting from linear models like decision trees, SVM and up
until deep learning models with transformers architecture (e.g.: BERT,
GPT2-3, XLNet), require massive amounts of data, usually provided as tabular data, to be trained and achieve model generalization and are
at the core of prediction analysis. Generally, studies and researches require
data from multiple datasets and linking one dataset to another can be a quite
difficult and troublesome task to perform, due to noise and incompleteness
of data, or simply because only one type of data is initially gathered.</p><div style="text-align:center"><img src="/img/pipeline-de.png"></div><p>A typical and usual example is the following (as shown in the figure above): a business,
through their applications, gathers data based on its working domain and
user base. Data is then extracted from the company databases where it
resides and it is then applied a filtering and data cleaning procedure (also
known as data preparation step) to obtain the needed data for an analysis
task. The initial set of data is usually not enough to perform the analysis
and, therefore, requires enrichment using external resource datasets.</p><p>Once the original data has been enriched, data analytics can be perfomed
and the results can then be presented to the end users. It is reported that
about 80% of time and effort for a data analytics project resides in the step
of data preparation.</p><p>It is therefore important to build and develop tools that enable data
scientists an easier and capable way to perform the enrichment of a table.
Semantic data can be exploited to make the enrichment process less of a
struggle by introducing two core steps:</p><ul><li><em>Reconciliation</em>: this task aims to map the mentions of the table to
a target KG. The reconciliation step is mainly focused on an entity
linking algorithm to perform the matching. While the reconciliation
is enabled through automatic processes, they can produce ambiguous
results given the amiguity of a table mention and they are usually
not enough to cover all the cases. Human knowledge and judgment is
usually employed to address those issues;</li><li><em>Extension</em>: once mentions have been mapped to entities of the KG,
URIs can be used to fetch new data from external data sources by
making use of the Linked Data.</li></ul></div><footer class="theme-doc-footer docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="theme-doc-footer-edit-meta-row row"><div class="col"><a href="https://github.com/I2Tunimib/I2T-docs/docs/intro.md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="theme-edit-this-page"><svg fill="currentColor" height="20" width="20" viewBox="0 0 40 40" class="iconEdit_mS5F" aria-hidden="true"><g><path d="m34.5 11.7l-3 3.1-6.3-6.3 3.1-3q0.5-0.5 1.2-0.5t1.1 0.5l3.9 3.9q0.5 0.4 0.5 1.1t-0.5 1.2z m-29.5 17.1l18.4-18.5 6.3 6.3-18.4 18.4h-6.3v-6.2z"></path></g></svg>Edit this page</a></div><div class="col lastUpdated_mt2f"></div></div></footer></article><nav class="pagination-nav docusaurus-mt-lg" aria-label="Docs pages navigation"><div class="pagination-nav__item"></div><div class="pagination-nav__item pagination-nav__item--next"><a class="pagination-nav__link" href="/I2T-docs/resources"><div class="pagination-nav__sublabel">Next</div><div class="pagination-nav__label">Resources<!-- --> Â»</div></a></div></nav></div></div><div class="col col--3"><div class="tableOfContents_vrFS thin-scrollbar theme-doc-toc-desktop"><ul class="table-of-contents table-of-contents__left-border"><li><a href="#semantic-table-interpretation-and-annotation" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Semantic Table Interpretation and Annotation</a><ul><li><a href="#instance-level-annotation" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Instance-level annotation</a></li><li><a href="#schema-level-annotation" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Schema-level annotation</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#semantic-table-enrichment" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Semantic Table Enrichment</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></main></div></div><footer class="footer"><div class="container"><div class="footer__bottom text--center"><div class="footer__copyright">Copyright Â© 2024 Insid&S Lab, Milano Bicocca.</div></div></div></footer></div>
